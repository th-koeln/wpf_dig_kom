The event was designed as a pilot project for future projects of this kind. Students from the countries
of France, Germany, Portugal, Greece and Bulgaria were to collaborate on a project collaboratively, in
mixed teams. The students should organize themselves completely independently. No tools were
provided for this. The students came from various fields, such as computer science, design and
communication. The project was started with an initial event in which all participating countries
received a briefing by videoconferencing. Afterwards, the work was carried out in the form of a multi-
page document. The task and information was written in English.
No milestones or timetables were specified. In total, the project had to be carried out about 10 days.
The challenge was to reorganize within an international team and to complete the work assignment
as successfully as possible. At the end of the event, the French participants were graded for their
achievements and had to present their own project to the customers. It was foreseen that the non-
French participants would also participate in the presentation.
