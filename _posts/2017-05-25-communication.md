This section lists various ways to increase communication within the team. It should be noted that
there is a spatial separation of the team members. Since the teams come from different countries and
the communication is compulsory in English, one should assume that each participant speaks English
confidently.

# Skype
The well-known instant messaging tool from Microsoft can now be more than a few years ago.
However, the main functions are the exchange of messages, internet telephony and video
conferences. In addition, Skype also provides the function of screen transmission. This allows a user
to transfer their own desktop to another user (also known as TeamViewer).

# Slack
Slack is a web-based instant messaging service that allows a team to share files, as well as provide
different rooms to communicate with each other. Chat rooms with different topics are created for this
purpose. Users can then join the appropriate room. Slack provides the integration of various services,
such as Google Drive. Slack works natively in the browser, but can also be used as a desktop app and
as a mobile app for both common operating systems.

# Trello
Bei Trello handelt es sich um eine reine webbasierte Projektmanagementsoftware. Trello bietet die
Möglichkeit an, auf sogenannten Boards, mit anderen Mitgliedern Listen zu erstellen. Diese können
dann beliebig bearbeitet und mit Checklisten, Anhängen und mit einem festgelegten Termin versehen
werden. Neben einer mobilen Version gibt es auch passend dazu Apps für beide gängigen Plattformen
sowie Windows.

# Git
Git is a free software for managing file diversion. It works distributed. This means that there is no
central sever, but each has its own local copy of the repository including the version history. Git is
mainly a tool for developers. Nevertheless, it is in any case one of the tools that is developed in large
projects in which software is developed. With Git, software can be better distributed. Everyone can
work on the same program. In the best case everyone gets a partial task and then independent and
independently from the other team. When someone is finished, only the part that has been edited by
the project member is added.

# Conclusion
There are relatively many tools you can use for project management. However, you have to pay
attention to what you need. Depending on the project type and affinity of the project members,
different tools can be used. Since not all students are IT Affin, one could consider whether one uses
several tools for different tasks. Skype offers the possibility to see in a videoconference, what would
be important for such a project, since this can be mediated trust.
As part of the project, a continuous exchange of information must take place, which is why you
should have an instant messaging tool. Furthermore, a board as described in the section "Scrum Board"
would also be useful. Also, a central place to exchange files would be very helpful. Especially
for developers the use of Git would be very helpful.
