In this section, you will find possible guidelines for the project, which could help the students to
improve the project.

# Project Plan

A rough project plan / course plan would be useful to determine when which parts of the project should be finished. With this specification, you can prevent the stagnation at a task or see the fulfilled tasks, which are already due. Also, this serves as a reference for the students so they do not put too much time into a themed area. The students could thereby assess their ability to test expenses.

# Items
Teachers could already develop rough tasks / items during the elaboration of the task, which the
students would have to divide again into sub-tasks. A major task at the beginning of the project could
be that the students could put together requirements for the system. This could be used to develop
use cases or user stories. These must then be implemented, for example, by the developers. By the
number of items to be done, the students would have a feeling for the effort that would still be
needed.


## Scrum-Board
The scrum-board is the tool that represents how far an item has been edited. This is mainly for the overview of the individual tasks and the progress. In general, the scrum-board is divided into several columns:

### Todos / Stories
Here are the items listed as stories, which must be implemented by the developers. This can be done
from the backlog or you can simply create new tasks. Often it is to create a story task, from which in
turn more can arise.

### Progress
Here are the tasks listed that should be currently handled by the project members.

### Testing Review
In this section, completed tasks are checked by other project members and, if necessary, tested for
acceptance criteria

### Done
This is where the tasks are performed when they are completely revised and meet all acceptance
criteria.

A scrum board could be created digitally, but also analog. There is a lot of free tools available online for this board, which also work very well. The illustration is only an example of a scrum board. It can be seen that the items have different colors to distinguish the type of the item. Another methodology in Scrum would be to place a sticker or point on an item after the last day, which was in the same state the previous day. This means that if Item 1 remains in the “Progress” area for three days, it will receive three stickers. This allows you to see how long an item is already in the

## Tools
With project work hardly any tools are needed. The problem is to make the right choice. Tools should
make working on a project more efficient. Since there were participants from different locations in
our project, one should absolutely use tools that enable constant communication to be maintained. If
possible via instant messaging or in the best case via voice or video conferencing. The next section
will deal with this topic.
