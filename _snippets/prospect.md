On the basis of the presented results and the experience gained in the project, clear pillars for a project of this measure can be formulated. The individual skills of the students should be considered. There should be fixed guidelines in project management.
Students probably do not have much experience in cross-department project management. None of the participants will be able to keep an overview of the whole project, as everyone will be responsible for their own area. Volunteer students or master students could be used as project managers. The tools can be predefined for the whole project. The way of communication was established intuitively, from the students. Those whose work has been evaluated have shown more initiative approach to communicate with other group members , one should consider possibly all students before the same situation. If each member knows that his work is being evaluated, everyone has the same motivation at best. 
Nevertheless, a Scrum Board would be very helpful for everyone. If possible, firstly develops stories from which small work packages can be leased. By using the Scrum Board, all participants can then see how far the project or the partial task has been processed. In summary, it can be said that such a project is very useful to carry out these framework conditions. 
Especially for advanced students, this would be a way to test his abilities and to almost got a taste of a real project. Nevertheless, the students should have a kind of guide available. The basic conditions are important. In doing so, they should not limit themselves to technologies, but should pay more attention to the functionality or scope of the project. The distribution into tasks would ensure that everyone knows in which task area he has to work.
