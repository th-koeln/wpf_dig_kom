It would make sense  to consider the division of tasks before beginning the work. In doing so, the effort should be
compared with the goal to be achieved. Also, it is very important from the ground up to distribute the
roles appropriately. In addition, it would be extremely useful to create an instance that attends the
progress of the project team throughout the project. In addition, a person as a product owner would
be very useful. This role should, if possible, be taken over by one of the organizers since there is no real
client. In the classic Scrum scenario, the product owner and the client must decide together what is
developed. However, since one of the two roles does not exist at all, they should reduce this and use a
reasonable alternative.

## Product Owner

The Product owner is actually the person that makes the requirements and carries out the acceptance tests. However, implementation in such a small project is very impractical. The role would be useful to provide the student with an instance that keeps the overview or controls the progress of the team.
Decrees would not have to happen as planned by the product owner, but could possibly be done by the whole team or by responsible persons.
It would also be useful to divide the role to several students. In practice, it looks as if each of the customers is responsible for a completed task or the entire team is classified as a customer. Thus, several people could review the completed tasks, which would result in the project participants having a better insight into the tasks of the others. The advantage would be early detection, where there may be a need for rework.

## System Architect

As a system architect, you should be responsible for setting up the system architecture. This includes
the choice of technology, as well as the installation and management of this technology. You should also make the preparation for domain models for the developers.
For example, the database models could already be created and discussed with the developers. These should then be introduced by the System Architect. The System Architect could take on the role of providing developers with the right stack and platform. Of course, this also implies the agreement of the developers. It would be optimal when all the requirements from the technical side would be done by the System Architect which would be responsible for all those decisions.

## Developer

The developers should devote themselves exclusively to the implementation of the software.
Depending on the technology, different skills are required. It would be an advantage if all developers
were on the same level, or if they were familiar with the same technologies. In order to be able to
work as efficiently as possible, the students should be able to use CVS or Git (or GitHub) as version
control. If you use these tools effectively, you can work much more effectively and collaboratively. By
creating different branches(feature Branches), each developer can work on their own sub-task.

## Designer

The design students should create mock-ups and / or a CI which can then be implemented by some of the developers. Basicly they could schedule 1 to 2 days for this task. In addition, they could help with the advertising campaign, as it was currently the case in our project.
