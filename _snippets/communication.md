This section lists various ways to increase communication within the team. It should be noted that there is a spacial separation of the team members. Since the teams comes from different countries and the communication is realized in English language, everyone should assume to speaks English fluently.

## Skype
The well-known instant messaging tool from Microsoft is now able to do more than a few years ago. However, the main functions are the exchange of messages, internet telephony and video conferences. In addition, Skype also provides the function of screen transmission. This allows a user to transfer their own desktop to another user (like TeamViewer or remote desktop connections).

## Slack
Slack is a web-based instant messaging service that allows a team to share files, as well as provide different rooms to communicate with each other. Chat rooms with different topics are created for this purpose. Users can then join the appropriate room. Slack provides the integration of various services, such as Google Drive. Slack works natively in your own browser, but can also be used as a desktop application and as a mobile app for both common operating systems(ios and android).

## Trello

Trello is a pure web-based project management software. Trello offers the possibility to create lists on known boards, with other members. These can then be processed as desired and with checklists, attachments and with a fixed appointment. In addition to a mobile version, there are also apps for both popular platforms and Windows mobile.

## Git
Git is a free software for managing file version control. It works distributed. That means that there is no central server, but each cliebt has its own local copy of the repository including the version history. Git is mainly a tool for developers. Nevertheless, it is in any case one of the tools that is developed in large projects in which software is developed. With git, software can be distributed better. Everyone can work on the same program code. In the best case everyone gets a partial task and then work independent from the other team members. When someone is finished, only the part that has been edited by the project member is added.

## Conclusion
There are relatively many tools you can use for project management. However, you have to pay attention to what you need. Depending on the project type and affinity of the project members, different tools can be used. Since not all students are familiarwith computerscience topics, they could consider whether they uses several tools for different tasks. Skype offers the possibility to use video-conference, which would be important for such a project, since this can be mediated trust to each member of the team.
As part of the project, a continuous exchange of information must take place, which is why you should have an instant messaging tool. Furthermore, a board as described in the section “Scrum Board” would also be useful. Also, a central place to exchange files could be very helpful. Especially for developers, the use of Git would be very helpful and recomenndet.
