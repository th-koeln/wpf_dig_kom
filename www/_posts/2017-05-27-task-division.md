It would make sense beforehand to consider the division of tasks. In doing so, the effort should be
compared with the goal to be achieved. Also, it is very important from the ground up to distribute the
rollers appropriately. In addition, it would be extremely useful to create an instance that controls the
progress of the project team throughout the project. In addition, a person as a product owner would
be useful. This role should, if possible, be taken over by one of the organizers since there is no real
client. In the classic Scrum, the product owner and the client must decide together what is
developed. However, since one of the two roles does not exist at all, one should reduce this and use a
sensible alternative.

# Product Owner
The Prodct Owner is actually the person who makes the requirements and carries out the acceptance
tests. However, implementation in such a small project is very impractical. The role would be useful to
provide the student with an instance that keeps the overview or controls the progress of the team.
Decrees would not have to happen as planned by the product owner, but could possibly be done by
the whole team or by responsible persons.
It would also be useful to divide the role to several students. In practice, it looks as if each of the
customers is responsible for a completed task or the entire team is classified as a customer. Thus,
several people could review the completed tasks, which would result in the project participants
having a better insight into the tasks of the others. The advantage would be early detection, where
there may be need for rework.

# System Architect
As a system architect, you should be responsible for setting up the system architecture. This includes
the choice of technology, as well as the installation and management of this technology. You should
also make the preparation for domain models for the developers. For example, database models
could already be created and discussed with the developers. These should then be introduced by the
System Architect. The System Architect could take on the role of providing developers with the right
platform. Of course, this also implies the agreement with the developers. It would be optimal if all
together the requirements from the technical side to the system and the System Architect these
implement.

# Developer
The developers should devote themselves exclusively to the implementation of the software.
Depending on the technology, different skills are required. It would be an advantage if all developers
were on the same level, or if they were familiar with the same technologies. In order to be able to
work as efficiently as possible, the students should be able to use CVS or Git (or GitHub) as version
control. If you use these tools effectively, you can work much more effectively collaboratively. By
creating different branches, each developer can work on their own sub-task.

# Designer
The design students should create mockups and / or a CI which can then be implemented by some of
the developers. In principle one could schedule 1 to 2 days for this task. In addition, they could help
with the advertising campaign, as was currently the case in our project.
